# MILESTONE 2 CODE

Milestone 2 code executes the following steps:
(1) creates a list of random words
(2) uses python random module to select a random word from that list
(3) takes user input, to be given as a single letter
(4) verifies whether user input is valid and prints a suitable message to that effect

# MILESTONE 3 CODE
Milestone 3 code is based on Milestone 2 code and executes the following steps:
(1) creates a list of random words
(2) uses python random module to select a random word from that list
(3) contains a function called ask_for_input which verifies whether user input is valid and prints a suitable message to that effect as well as implements another function called check_guess which verifies whether this letter is contained within a randomly generated word in step (2) and once again prints message to that effect.
